[Going (Back To) Paper: My Digital Disintegration][link1] :: _Jamie Todd Rubin_  
I've been reading Jamie's Going Paperless posts for over a year now, when I saw this post on April 1st it really did make me laugh.  

  
[Amazon introduces Cloud Drive File Sync for OSÂ X][link2] :: _TUAW_  
Amazon cloud storage has been around for a while, but I've avoided it because of the lack of any kind of sync option on the mac. Now that Amazon has released their new File Sync app, I've added it to the list of things to try at some point. I doubt its going to replace Dropbox for me, but having access to another 5GB of cloud storage can't be a bad thing!  

  
[How to Set Up Your Own Private Cloud Storage Service in Five Minutes with OwnCloud][link3] :: _LifeHacker_  
Speaking of cloud storage, LifeHacker have a great article which looks at the open-source OwnCloud which allows you to setup your own Cloud system. I've had a brief play with OwnCloud and I can see the advantages of setting up a system with remains completely under my control.  

  
[Old Mac Of The Month: The iMac G5][link4] :: _512 Pixels_  
A fantastic article which takes a look at the old G5 iMac, the thing which stood out to me was just how simple it was to add or replace its components. As someone who was responsible for running a mac network for 5 years, I just wish the intel iMacs had been just as easy to maintain. Considering the current state of apple hardware, constantly getting smaller and smaller, I really doubt we will ever see an iMac with this kind of maintainability again.  

  
[iThoughtsHD: Grow Ideas][link5] :: _App Storm_  
I keep toying with the idea of picking up iThoughtsHD, but I've struggle to see exactly how it can fit into my workflow. Chris Cooper over on App Storm has written an outstanding review of the software, which takes you through the key features.
