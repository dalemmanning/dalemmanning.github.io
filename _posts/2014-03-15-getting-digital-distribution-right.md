Over the past couple of weeks, I've been reading a lot more comics both old and new. After listening to [episode 3][GiantSizeEp3] of the recently relaunched Giant Size which focused on new and aspiring readers, I was inspired to give a few new titles a try. Up until now I've always brought my graphics novels in paperback, mainly because I always felt they looked good on the shelf. However my flat isn't exactly the largest and I'm running out of storage space pretty fast. After hearing so much about comixology on various podcasts I was more than ready to setup an account and get buying. However after doing some further research, I decided that maybe that wasn't my best option.

You see it turns out that with Comixology you don't actually purchase the comic, you just lease it. Now this isn't necessarily something new, in fact if you read the Kindle terms and conditions you can quickly see that they operate in exactly the same way.

> **Use of Kindle Content**. Upon your download of Kindle Content and payment of any applicable fees (including applicable taxes), the Content Provider grants you a non-exclusive right to view, use, and display such Kindle Content an unlimited number of times, solely on the Kindle or a Reading Application or as otherwise permitted as part of the Service, solely on the number of Kindles or Supported Devices specified in the Kindle Store, and solely for your personal, non-commercial use. Kindle Content is licensed, not sold, to you by the Content Provider. The Content Provider may include additional terms of use within its Kindle Content. Those terms will also apply, but this Agreement will govern in the event of a conflict. Some Kindle Content, such as Periodicals, may not be available to you through Reading Applications.

Now with the kindle this doesn't actually bother me to much, for a number of reasons. The first is that Amazon aren't likely to go anywhere anytime soon, the second is that I don't generally re-read books that often so if I lose access to a book it's not the end of the world. However when it comes to comics/graphic novels, I enjoy rereading them and as a result losing access to them would really annoy me. So I started doing some more research into my options and found that there are a few publishers that let you purchase DRM-free comics in a range of formats.

Image Comics was the first one I checked out, not only do they have a pretty large library but it's also home to one of my favourite comics - The Walking Dead, as well as a number of the new comic books I was interested in. I decided to give their store a trial run before I invested any money, so I downloaded the first issues of [Saga][SagaIssue1], [Sex Criminals][SexCriminalIssue1], [Lazarus][LazarusIssue1] and [East of West][EastofWestIssue1], which were all free.

Once you have purchased your comics, you can chose to download them as PDF, ePub, cbr or cbz and they also remain in your library so they can be downloaded again. I was impressed enough that I decided to bring myself up to date with the four series I tried out plus the walking dead. It would be fair to say this was a reasonable investment and in some cases slightly more than comixology but I now own each issue I just purchased. The only thing that bugged me a little was that times their site could be a little sluggish, but I'm happy to put up with it for what get in return.

There was one more publisher I was interested in ... 2000AD, home of Judge Dredd. I've been working my way through the complete case files releases and loving every minute of it.

I had heard that 2000AD operated in the same way as Image and after a little investigating I'm pleased to say that they offer DRM-free comics as well, although they only offer the choice if PDF or cbz. The biggest bonus: each release of the case files is only Â£9.99, which is generally a couple of pound cheaper then the paperback releases.

On a side note, I'm using two different comic readers on my iPad - [ComicGlass][ComicGlass] and [Chunky Comic Reader][ChunkyReader]. Both handle the cbz files from either publisher brilliantly.

Overall I'm really impressed with what both publishers are offering and I intend on purchasing the new releases each month. I really hope that other publishers follow their example and start releasing their comics in a DRM-free format.  After all in this current age when we are being encouraged to go digital, is it to much to ask that we get to own what we are purchasing.

However before anyone feels this is a post attacking Comixology, I would really like to make it clear that I have nothing but respect for them. What they have achieved over the past few years is nothing but remarkable! They have created a system which allows a lot of people to have access to thousands of comics instantly and for that they deserve a medal.
