When I started this blog it was to provide me with an outlet, both in terms of my interests and in terms of my continuing efforts against my depression and anxiety. Back in December I began the process of being publicly open about my mental health issues by writing [this post][dmmtalk]. 

Its been a while since I've posted about how I'm feeling and for the most part things have been going well. Just like anyone I still have the occasional bad day, but a few weeks ago I had a pretty nasty episode of depression. An episode which reminded me that depression is __SNEAKY!__

In theory I should have been on top of the world, I had just finished my final OU assignment and was slowly getting used to having my weekends back to myself. Yet I felt awful and I couldn't really figure out why, I had completely missed the _'triggers'_ I had trained myself to watch for. Now that I've had time to reflect on it, I had been lulled into a false sense of security. I had been feeling pretty 'normal' (maybe not the best word but hopefully you understand what I mean) and I hadn't had an episode in a long time. This particular episode really did creep up on me, I didn't see it coming - I just woke up one morning and realised something wasn't right.

When I'm feeling low, my paranoia starts to increase and a fog starts to cloud things. By things I mean every aspect of my life, my ability to make decisions becomes incredibly impaired and all of those small things which happen to everyone and I shouldn't let get to me - start affecting me in a big way. Its not a great way to spend your day and truth be told, I don't really like who I become when I've having an episode like this. I start thinking everyone is out to get me (that would be the paranoia) and as a result I become short-tempered and defensive. The problem is that once I start disliking myself, the whole cycle starts again and continues to repeat. My therapist told me during my CBT that I have to work on my process of forgiving myself and acknowledge the fact that I am allowed to have a bad day (something I've always been terrible at).

In the end it was my parents and friends who helped to pull me out of the episode, they got me back to a place where I could start to rebuild the defences inside my head.

So how am I feeling now? Actually pretty good, I've realised that even when I'm feeling good I need to continue applying everything I learnt during therapy, something which I had allowed myself to forget. I'm posting this as a public record of the fact that regardless of what you feel is happening to you, there is very little you can't get past with the aid of the people who love and care about you. 

Most importantly - remember to be kind and forgiving of yourself, after all you're only human!
