So I've been playing around with a few methods of using my iPad in the classroom (I teach Media Studies and Music at a secondary school) and I thought I would share them. In particular these methods focus on controlling your mac or displaying your iPad through your Mac.

__Method 01: iPad + Rowmote = Wireless keyboard and mouse for your mac__

So the first method is one that I've been using for a while and even mentioned briefly in a earlier blog post in which I shared [my iPad home screen](http://scriptogr.am/dalemmanning/post/my-ipad-home-screen/ "My iPad Home Screen").

Rowmote is an really great little app which allows you to use your iPad as a wireless controller for your mac. It is available in two different flavours:

- Rowmote: Which essentially takes the place of the white/aluminium remote you used to get with macs. It provides you with the basic play/stop/forward/back controls you need to control a large majority of the media apps you will find on your mac.
- Rowmote Pro: This version gives you everything the standard version does as well as a remote keyboard and mouse.

I used to write up on the classroom whiteboard, however the truth is my writing was never that great. At the beginning of the school year I realised I needed to find a method which would make it easier for my students to follow what was being written on the board. Rowmote is that method, now whenever I need to write notes and discussions up on the board I will simply bring up a blank Pages document and start typing.

This provides me with two big advantages:

- I am now able to stand anywhere in the classroom and continue to write on the board, I'm no longer confined to the front of the room.
- The class notes can be easily saved and recalled in future lessons or uploaded onto our VLE for reference by the students.

I've been using Rowmote virtually everyday since the start of term and it's a brilliant app, yes occasionally it takes a little while to connect to the mac I want to control but 98% of the time its been very reliable.

The standard version will set you back £0.69 and can be upgraded to the pro version for a £2.49 in-app purchase. The pro version costs £2.99. Both versions require the free rowmote helper software in order to control your mac.

__Method 02: Mac + AirServer = AppleTV__

This method is a fairly new one for me and I've only really been making use of it over the past few weeks. The biggest advantage of the iPad and AppleTV combo is you can display your iPad screen on your TV/Projector. Unfortunately we don't have any AppleTV units connected to our projectors at work and this is where AirServer comes in. 

Once you install AirServer it will allow you to display your iPad in a window on your macs screen. If that mac is connected to a projector you've got yourself an AppleTV! It's worked pretty well over the last few weeks and I've really enjoyed being able to use it in lessons without having to be connected via a VGA adapter.

AirServer is available as a 7 day free trial if you want try it out and I really recommend that you do. They also provide a range of different purchase options from a standard licence to education/multi-volume. It is also available for Windows so even if you don't use macs in your school your can still give it a go.

__Method 03: *Actions for iPad*__

Ok so this method is so new I've only had it installed on my iPad for a few days, but it looks like its going to have a lot of potential and I'm looking forward to really giving it a proper test.

Actions essentially allows you to create a completely customisable remote control, if an action can be carried out with a keyboard shortcut then it can be programmed into Actions. I haven't really had time to play around with this properly yet, so I'm not completely sure where it will fit into my workflow. Once I have I will write an update and post it for anyone who is interested.

So thats it, three different methods for using the iPad in a classroom environment. I'm not saying they are perfect and I'm pretty sure that I'll be tweaking these or replacing them completely over the next few weeks as I spot new apps to play around with but hey, I'm a geek! Thats what I supposed to do!
