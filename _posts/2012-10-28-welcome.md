Hi! Welcome to my blog which will primarily focus on Technology, Film and TV along with the occasional helping of Games, Comics and Music. 

I guess I should explain why I've started the blog, well I want to try and write regularly for something other than work or study. I've always admired people who have the ability to post their thoughts online and after spending many, many hours each week reading blog posts on various sites I decided I wanted to give it a go.

Now I will be honest this type of writing has never come easily to me, so please bear with me while I try and get used to things!
