[aText][link1] :: _Tran Ky Nam Software_  
I've been toying with the idea of getting some text expansion software for a while, but I could never convince myself to spend Â£25 on Text Expander. Well a couple of weeks ago I found aText and after trying the demo, I've purchased it. While I can't be sure that it does everything Text Expander does, it certainly meets all of my needs and the best part of all it only costs $5!   

_A friendly tip for you, while it is available from the Mac App Store if you buy it direct from the developer you will get access to the dropbox syncing!_
  
[Macheist nanoBundle 3][link2] :: _Macheist_  
I love software bundles and I'm always on the lookout for a good deal. Well the guys over at MacHeist have done it again, with their latest nanobundle. It contains some apps I've been looking at for a while - Fantastical, Clarify, Clean My Mac and Pathfinder (unlocked at 30K bundles sold). On top of that it also includes the fantastic AirServer (which allows you to mirror your iOS device to your mac) and the animation software iStopMotion. The total cost is only $9.99 and at the time of writing this its only available for 2 more days.
  
[Solar for iPhone][link3] :: _iTunes_  
I stumbled across this app during my daily check for any changes on the app store. Its a very simple weather app however what makes it stand out for me, is just how beautiful it looks. I've been so impressed with it in fact, its found a place on my home screen (never an easy thing to do!). At the time of writing this, it is currently free and I highly recommend you give it a look.
  
[Hemlock Grove][link4] :: _Netflix_  
On Friday, Netflix premiered there new series 'Hemlock Grove' directed by Eli Roth. So far I've only watched the first two episodes, so its a little early to tell exactly where its going but so far I've been impressed. It looks like Netflix are on a roll with their exclusives, first of all with the outstanding House of Cards and now this. If you have a Netflix subscription its worth giving a try and seeing what you think.  
  
[Premiere Episode of Defiance][link5] :: _iTunes_  
So Defiance premiered this week, I'll be honest I've been genuinely excited by this for a while now and I've been playing the game more or less from launch day. However, I don't have access to the SyFy channel and as a result missed the Television broadcast. So I was very very happy to see iTunes offering the pilot double episode as a free download. I loved every minute of it and can't wait to see the rest of the series, it gets my highest possible recommendation!
