A slight name change to this feature, as it occurred to me that not everything I want to share could necessarily be considered an article!  So here are the _'things'_ which you may have missed:

[James Woods: the tragedy of current film preservation efforts][denofgeek] :: _Den Of Geek_  
So at the beginning of the week Den Of Geek ran an article discussing the [under appreciated films][denofgeekJames] of James Woods, which in itself is a good read containing some great films. The link above takes you to the response they received from Mr Woods himself, in which he talks about his appreciation for his fans and the little that is being done to preserve the films for the 80's and 90's (something which I agree with!). Its great to see someone like James Woods taking time out to respond to his fans in such a public and polite way.

[Patrick Welkerâ€™s Sweet Mac Setup][shawnblanc] :: _Shawn Blanc_  
I love reading about other people's Mac setups and Shawn Blanc's series of _['Sweet Mac Setups'][shawnblancSweet]_ is always worth a read, but I was blown away this week by this article featuring Patrick Welker. Be warned you are going to need a little while to read this one, but I promise it is worth it. It is a fascinating look into his workflow and setup.

[XtraFinder add Tabs and features to Mac Finder][trankynam] :: _Tran Ky Nam Software_  
While reading though the 'Marked' iBook over the past week, I noticed that David Sparks had tabs in his finder. While I can't be sure that this is the software he uses but it certainly does the job as well as adding some great features into the Finder and it's FREE! Considering how many Finder windows I will generally end up opening during a session, this is going to make things so much easier for me.  

[Plain Text Primer: nvALT 101][bettermess] :: _Michael Schechter - A Better Mess_  
So I've been reworking my writing workflow again and during the week I made the decision to return to dropbox for all of my text based files. Over the past few months I've been using iA Writer via iCloud and having my files locked away in the little iCloud box was starting to get pretty annoying. So I made the decision to drop iCloud from that part of my workflow and this article by Michael Schechter offered me the final structure I needed to make it work.

[Markdown Service Tools][brettterpstra] :: _Brett Terpstra_   
No doubt about it Brett Terpstra is possibly one of the smartest men alive! I've been working pretty hard to move to a completely Markdown based writing workflow over the past few weeks and his range of Markdown service tools have made things so much easier. If you are interested in Markdown, do yourself a favour and check them out.
