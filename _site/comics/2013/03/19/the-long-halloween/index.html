    <h2 class="posttitle">Batman Reread 01 - The Long Halloween</h2>
    <p class="muted">19 March 2013</p>
    <p>Inspired by a recent episode of the Comic Shack podcast on the 5by5 network, in which the excellent Moises Chiullan is joined by John Gholson to discuss the stories you should read if you want to get into Batman (<a href="http://5by5.tv/comicshack/27" title="Comic Shack: Episode 27">Direct Link</a>). I decided to begin rereading the Batman graphic novels which currently occupy my bookshelf - starting with 'The Long Halloween'.</p>

<p>The Long Halloween is made up of 13 issues written by Jeph Leob, with the art work being provided by Tim Sale. Originally published in 1996 to 1997, the storyline takes place over the course of a year and in terms of continuity, continues the storyline of Batman: Year One. So we get to see Batman pretty early in his career, continuing to build his relationship with Lieutenant James Gordon and working alongside District Attorney Harvey Dent for one of the first times.</p>

<p>The central plot is based on Batman trying to stop the killer know as 'Holiday', who only kills on holidays. Each of the thirteen issues deal with a particular holiday, with the first and last being rather appropriately Halloween.</p>

<blockquote><p><em>Do you know what my people call this past year? The Long Halloween</em> - Carmine "The Roman" Falcone</p></blockquote>

<p>Batman, Gordon and Dent make a pact to work together to stop 'Holiday' and over the course of the story we get to see just how fragile this relationship actually is with rather large amounts of suspicion being shown by all of the parties involved. We also run into the various antagonists of Batman including Poison Ivy, The Riddler, The Scarecrow and The Mad Hatter, yet at no point do you feel they have just been included for the sake of it; each serves a real purpose. Although the highlight for me has to be the inevitable confrontation with the Joker, which in a rather unusual twist takes place on a crop-duster!</p>

<blockquote><p><em><strong>Batman:</strong> You're insane. <strong>Joker:</strong> Has it really taken you this long to notice?</em></p></blockquote>

<p>At it's heart The Long Halloween is a murder mystery, one which is filled with many different twists and turns. We actually get to see Batman being a detective, something which is forgotten in many of the later stories and just as with any detective he isn't always successful. In fact one of the major strengths of the story is that 'Holiday' constantly outwits him and as it moves on we get to see a Batman who is clearly becoming desperate to stop the killing. I get the impression that while he has learnt a great deal since Year One, he still realises he has a long way to go and this is possibly what pains him the most.</p>

<p>While reading this you can see the influences the storyline had on Nolan's 'Batman Begins' and 'The Dark Knight', with many scenes appearing in the films. For example, Batman meeting with Dent and Gordon on the roof of the GCPD in the Dark Knight, could have been lifted straight from the pages of the Long Halloween.</p>

<p>In short, I really enjoyed rereading it and still consider it to be one of the essential stories which needs to be read by anyone who wants to learn more about the early career of Batman.  Loeb creates an extraordinary story which weaves through the 13 issues and constantly leaves you guessing right until the very end (I think it fair to say you won't see it coming!).</p>
