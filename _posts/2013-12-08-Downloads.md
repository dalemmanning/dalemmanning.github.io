Over the years I've carried out a lot of training and written a lot of software guides in order to ease the transition for new users. Now I will be the first to admit they may not be perfect but they have received positive feedback and I've decided to share them on the site in a new [downloads section][DMDownloads].

While the iLife guides are for the '09 and '11 versions, I am in the process of creating new versions for iLife '13. Once I've finished writing them I will upload them as well.

All of the downloads are licenced under the [Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License][CCLicense], which is fairly open and all I ask is that you respect the licence guidelines.
