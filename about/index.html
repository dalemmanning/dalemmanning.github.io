<p>Other than the stuff in the sidebar, what can I say about myself...

<p>I am currently working as a UQT teaching Media Studies and Music at a secondary school but I also help to drive the schools ICT policies and use of technology.</p>

<p>I recently completed by Open University Open Degree achieving a 2.2 with honours. In September 2013, I begin the final leg of my journey towards becoming a fully qualified teacher.</p>

<p>I started this blog while undergoing CBT therapy in order to have an outlet for views and creative side. Most importantly I wanted to start writing for myself rather than work or study.</p>
