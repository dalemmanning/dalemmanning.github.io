    <h2 class="posttitle">Using Flickr</h2>
    <p class="muted">17 February 2014</p>
    <p><p>Flickr is a combination of photo storage and photo sharing, providing you with access to 1TB of free storage. In regard to photo sharing the general idea behind Flickr is that anything you upload is public and therefore anyone can see it. However it is possible to change those default settings so everything you upload remains private. This post will talk you through making use of Flickr to create a private photo storage area, which can be shared with family and friends if you want.</p>

    <p class="muted">16 February 2014</p>
    <p><p>One statement I hear on an almost daily basis is that you can't do that on an iPad, 'that' could be creating a document, spreadsheet or presentation, or anything else which would be considered as needing to be done on a 'traditional' computer. I was talking to a colleague at school recently who asked me about buying a laptop in order to allow them to work from home. When I enquired about the iPad they own, they told me it could only be used for surfing and e-mail, not for proper work.</p>

    <h2 class="posttitle">Reflection</h2>
    <p class="muted">10 August 2013</p>
    <p><p>This time of year is always a strange one for me, as a teacher I am lucky enough to get a 5-6 week summer holiday. During the past 8 years I've generally had assignments due in the summer period, however as I have now completed my degree (more on that in a bit) I actually have this summer to myself. Its usually this break I have the most trouble with, to suddenly go from being surrounded by 1400 students and seeing your friends everyday, to being on your own for extended periods of time takes some getting used to and in the past has lead to me feeling very low. So as I approached this summer break, I was a little anxious about things but I made myself a two promises. The first is that I wouldn't let my depression get the best of me and the second is that I wouldn't feel guilty about taking sometime for myself (<em>something I have a very nasty habit of doing</em>).</p>

    <p class="muted">05 August 2013</p>
    <p><p>Hopefully you have noticed that the blog has received a new look and indeed a new home! I am now the proud owner of dalemmanning.me.uk and this redesign represents something I've been thinking about ever since I actually started blogging. I've always believed that if you want to write something public you need to be brave enough to put your own name on it and so this is my final step to doing that (<em>although I also fully acknowledge that there are times when remaining anonymous is important as well</em>).</p>

    <p><p><a href="http://www.trankynam.com/atext/">aText</a> :: <em>Tran Ky Nam Software</em><br/>
I've been toying with the idea of getting some text expansion software for a while, but I could never convince myself to spend Â£25 on Text Expander. Well a couple of weeks ago I found aText and after trying the demo, I've purchased it. While I can't be sure that it does everything Text Expander does, it certainly meets all of my needs and the best part of all it only costs $5!</p>

    <p class="muted">02 April 2013</p>
    <p><p>When I started this blog it was to provide me with an outlet, both in terms of my interests and in terms of my continuing efforts against my depression and anxiety. Back in December I began the process of being publicly open about my mental health issues by writing <a href="http://dalemmanning.wordpress.com/2012/12/15/its-time-to-talk/">this post</a>.</p>
