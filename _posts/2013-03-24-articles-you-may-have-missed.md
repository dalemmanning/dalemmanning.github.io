Articles you may have missed: 24-03-2013

Here are some of the articles I've found interesting over the past week.

- _[Inside Secrets of the Making of Star Trek II: Wrath of Khan and "Space Seed"!](http://io9.com/inside-secrets-of-the-making-of-star-trek-ii-wrath-of-457250013) :: io9_ - An excellent article which looks into the evolution of one of the greatest Star Trek villains of all time, really worth a read if you are a fan.

- _[Producers David Benioff, Dan Weiss & George R.R. Martin Talk GAME OF THRONES Season 3 and 4, Martinâ€™s Cameo, the End of the Series, and More](http://collider.com/game-of-thrones-season-3-4-george-r-r-martin-interview/) :: Collider_ - An interesting interview with the producers of Game Of Thrones and author George R.R. Martin in which they discuss the task of translating the books to screen. With Season 3 starting in just a few short days, it provides some great background.


- _[The Fading Grandeur of Abandoned Soviet Space Facilities](http://io9.com/the-fading-grandeur-of-abandoned-soviet-space-facilitie-456896333) :: io9_ - It always fascinates me when facilities are just abandoned. io9 have put together a great collection of images which shows whats left of various Soviet Space facilities, which are abandoned after the fall of the Soviet Union. It's worth following the source links as well in order to get some great background information (although I will admit my inability to read russian did make this a little difficult!).


- _[How to Enable Two-Step Verification for Your Apple ID](http://www.macstories.net/news/how-to-enable-two-step-verification-for-your-apple-id/) :: MacStories_ - Apple have finally rolled out Two-Step verification for customers living in the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, Ireland, and New Zealand. MacStories as usual have put together an in-depth guide to the getting it all setup.

- _[New Field Guide: Markdown]http://macsparky.com/blog/2013/3/new-field-guide-markdown) :: MacSparky_ - David Sparks of Mac Power Users, has released his third MacSparky field guide co-written with Eddie Smith. This time he focuses on using Markdown, I've been a markdown convert for around the past 6 months but I also know I've only just scratched the surface of what can be achieved. All of his previous field guides have been fantastic and I didn't hesitate in purchasing this.

Thats it for this week there will be more next Sunday.
