I've been working on this post for a while now, I needed to make sure I got it right. This post has come about for a number of different reasons, the first is that I was inspired by a post by Wil Wheaton (you can read it [here](http://wilwheaton.net/2012/09/depression-lies/ "Wil Wheaton Depression Lies")), the second is that if what I'm about to say can help even one person then its worth it and the most important reason ... I want to pay tribute to both my family and my friends for helping me through a really tough time and I want that tribute to be out there for anyone to read.

I guess I should start at the beginning, my name is Dale and I have depression and anxiety (Wow, that feels strange, just like Mr Wheaton I've never said this publicly before). I've been dealing with depression on and off for a long time, I remember my first really bad period being when I was 20 (I'm 30 now). At various points over the past 10 years, I've been on and off medication. It was something which I was **very** resistant to at first, I guess I always saw it as admitting defeat. These days I don't see as being any different from a diabetic taking insulin, if that one little tablet helps to keep me on an even level and allows to me get on with my life then that's what I need.

However around 6 months ago things got really bad and I genuinely felt like I'd hit rock bottom. For anyone who has never dealt with depression, it can leave you feeling extremely confused, lonely and incredibly miserable. In my case it also started affecting my ability to deal with the small things. My work and my home life were drastically becoming affected and I realised that I needed help.

So I began undergoing cognitive behaviour therapy and I can honestly say its one of the best things I've ever done. It's allowed me to start understanding my ’triggers’ and I'm starting to build up my abilities to deal with them. Most importantly its allowed me to accept who I am and feel comfortable with myself for the first time in years.

If I'm honest I'm not sure if I had tried the therapy a few years ago it would have been so successful. Realistically I think I needed to get to where I was before I was ready to fully embrace the therapy and while it has been extremely draining and hard, I seriously believe I'm stronger for it. 

A couple of weeks ago I completed my therapy. Am I cured? No, I think in someways I will always be dealing with this, but I also think I'm starting to win the battle. Yes I will still have bad days (*after all who doesn't?*) However I can now see that while I may always have depression and anxiety, depression and anxiety won't always **have** me! I can control it!

The most important factor in all of this, in this entire journey I've gone through is that without my friends and family none of it would have happened, without them I would still be in an extremely bad place, without them I wouldn't have the strength to write this post.

So this is dedicated to all of them; to my parents who have been through every single up and down with me over the past 10 years.  I know it hasn't been easy but I couldn't have asked for a more supportive Mum and Dad; to my brother, my sister and my niece who have welcomed me with open arms every time I have needed it constantly reminding me that everything will be ok; finally to my closest friends who have stood by my side every step of the way, constantly looking out for me and never once turning their backs on me.

I love each and everyone of you, seriously without your support I honestly don't know where I'd be today.

Thank you ...
