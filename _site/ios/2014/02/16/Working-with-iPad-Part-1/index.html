    <h2 class="posttitle">Working with the iPad - Part 1</h2>
    <p class="muted">16 February 2014</p>
    <p>One statement I hear on an almost daily basis is that you can't do that on an iPad, 'that' could be creating a document, spreadsheet or presentation, or anything else which would be considered as needing to be done on a 'traditional' computer. I was talking to a colleague at school recently who asked me about buying a laptop in order to allow them to work from home. When I enquired about the iPad they own, they told me it could only be used for surfing and e-mail, not for proper work.</p>

<p>This type of statement drives me crazy and in some cases has lead to some pretty heated discussions about how this just isn't true. What frustrates me the most is that many people still view the iPad as a 'consumption' device, now don't get me wrong it is a stunning device for this purpose but it is capable of so much more. In order to try and prove this to everyone, I've been using my iPad as my main work device for the past 6 months. This post will attempt to share what I have learnt and hopefully help others to see how their iPad can be used on a daily basis to be productive in the workplace, in particular the education workplace.</p>

<h4>Hardware</h4>

<p>So lets start off with an overview of the hardware I use, this will obviously change from person-to-person but I figured that you it would be useful for you to know what hardware I had invested in.</p>

<h5>iPad Air</h5>

<p>This is an upgrade which took place only a few months ago but I couldn't be happier. I previously had the 3rd and 1st Gen Wifi iPad, so it would be safe to say that I'm invested in what the device can do. I used my 3rd gen, exclusively as my main work device for a term and I was extremely happy with the result; however when they announced the iPad Air I knew that the new CPU could make an even bigger difference.</p>

<p>After running the iPad Air for almost three months, I am extremely happy with what it can do â€” although I haven't come anywhere near pushing it to its full potential. I own the 64GB WiFi model, while the Cellular model was tempting I haven't really found a need for cellular access in the past and when I have I just put my iPhone in hotspot mode.</p>

<p>I really can't put enough emphasis on just how powerful the iPad Air is, bench mark tests show that compared to the 4th Gen iPad it is 80% faster and 5 times faster than the 3rd Gen. If you are interested in viewing the full benchmark results you can <a href="http://www.primatelabs.com/blog/2013/10/ipad-air-benchmarks/">click here</a>.</p>

<h5>Wacom Bamboo Stylus</h5>

<p>It might seem strange to see a stylus listed under the hardware that I use and it would even go against what Apple believed, at least according to Steve Jobs. During the original iPhone keynote, he said:</p>

<blockquote><p>We're going to use the best pointing device in the world, we're going to use the point device we are all born with; we're born with 10 of them. We're going to use our fingers.</p></blockquote>

<p>Now I do agree with this, 90% of the time our fingers are ideal for using the iPad however there are times when using a stylus just makes things so much easier. Especially when it comes to marking student work in apps such as iAnnotate (more on that later on).</p>

<p>I've tried various stylus over the past few years and eventually settled on the Wacom Bamboo Stylus. It feel solid in your hands and has the huge advantage of having replaceable nibs. Unfortunately Wacom do not seem to make my exact model anymore but you can find their full range by <a href="http://www.wacom.com/en/us/everyday">clicking here</a>.</p>

<p>One piece of advice I would give is to try and play around with a few different stylus until you find one that works for you.</p>

<h5>Wired Projection: Digital AV Adapter / VGA Adapter</h5>

<p>I'll be honest a wired connection isn't my preferred method of connecting to a projector, as I like having the freedom of walking around the classroom but unfortunately I don't always have that option. Both the Digital AV / VGA lightening adapters provide you with the option of plugging in your power cable in order to keep your device charged.</p>

<p>These adapters are also available for the older iPad generations in various different forms.</p>

<h5>Wireless Projection Option 1: AppleTV</h5>

<p>The AppleTV is a fantastic piece of kit which as well as being a media player for your iTunes content, also allows you mirror your iPad screen via airplay. While we don't yet have any at school, in large part due to a lack of HDMI projectors I do have one at home and really like the ease of which you can AirPlay to the device. You can find out more about the AppleTV by <a href="http://www.apple.com/appletv/">clicking here</a>.</p>

<p>If you don't have HDMI projectors, you still have the ability to use an AppleTV via the Kanex ATV Pro, an VGA to HDMI adapter. I've never used one myself however all of the reports I've read are positive. You can find out more by <a href="http://www.kanexlive.com/atvpro">clicking here</a>.</p>

<h5>Wireless Projection Option 2: AirServer</h5>

<p>One thing I do have a abundance of at work is projectors with either a Mac or PC attached to them, which is where AirServer comes into play; this relatively small app turns your computer into an AirPlay receiver. The most recent version of the software has been upgraded to fully support iOS 7 and adds a screen recording option.</p>

<p>The nicest advantage of AirServer is that it is available for both Mac and PC, as well as being considerably cheaper than buying AppleTV for every classroom. You can find more information by <a href="http://www.airserver.com">clicking here</a>.</p>

<h4>iCloud</h4>

<p>iCloud is an important piece of the iOS experience, it provides you with you many features which will make your life considerably easier. When you turn on an iOS device for the first time, you will be prompted to create a new account or enter existing account information. If you enter an existing account all of your important data (such as contacts, notes and documents) will be downloaded to your new device.</p>

<h5>Backups</h5>

<p>The backup feature of iOS is an important one, I can honestly say that my devices rarely get plugged into my computer anymore so that the regular backups that used to be made that way are gone. By turning on iCloud backups on, whenever you charge your device and has a Wifi connection it completes a backup.</p>

<p>While it will prompt you to turn on backups during the setup of a new device, if you didn't do this during the setup process you can turn it on by going into:</p>

<blockquote><p><em>Settings</em> > <em>iCloud</em> > <em>Storage &amp; Backup</em> > <em>iCloud Backup</em>.</p></blockquote>

<p>Depending on just how much data you keep on your device, the backup size will vary. You only get 5GB of free storage, so it may become necessary to trim down your backup size in order to stay within the limit. You can do this by going into:</p>

<blockquote><p><em>Settings</em> > <em>iCloud</em> > <em>Storage &amp; Backup</em> > <em>Manage Storage</em> > <em>Select the device which has been backed up</em>.</p></blockquote>

<p>You can now go through a list of your apps and select which ones you would like to have backed up. In the future if you need ever purchase a new device or perform a restore on an existing one, you will be presented with the option of restoring a backup.</p>

<h5>Find My iPhone</h5>

<p>The Find my iPhone service allows you to track all of your iOS and OS X devices should they get lost or stolen. The service can be accessed via the iCloud website or the Find my iPhone app.</p>

<p>Once you have logged into the service, providing the device has an active data connection you will be shown its location on a map and presented with three options:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Play Sound:</strong> Plays an extremely loud pinging sound effect, even if the device is in silent mode.</li>
<li><strong>Lost Mode:</strong> Locks your device until your passcode or the passcode you are prompted to enter is put into the device. You can also enter contact details and a message which be displayed on the device until it is unlocked. if the device is connected to a network it will lock immediately, otherwise it will wait until it is connected to a network.</li>
<li><strong>Erase iPhone:</strong> This allows you to send a remote erase command to your device, effectively rendering it useless to anyone who has it. As with lost mode, if the device is connected to a network the wipe will begin immediately, otherwise it will wait until it is connected to a network.</li>
</ul>


<p>A few people have asked what happens if it is never connected to a network, I will admit this is a possibility but a very small one. Consider just how much we have to do online, just about everything we would want to do with a mobile device relies on a data connection.</p>

<p>Apple provide extremely detailed documentation on the Find my iPhone service which can be found by <a href="https://www.apple.com/support/icloud/find-my-device/">clicking here</a>.</p>

<h5>Mail / Calendars</h5>

<p>While Mail and Calendars might seem fairly straightforward it is important to remember that iCloud will keep them synced across all of your devices and allow you to access them via the iCloud website.</p>

<h5>Reminders</h5>

<p>Reminders can be an extremely powerful organisational tool, providing you with the ability to create separate lists and then assign reminders to them. These reminders can be setup to either present an alarm at a particular time or when you encounter a geofence.</p>

<p>A geofence allows you to set a particular location as a trigger point, for example I use my workplace as a geofence when I reach the school site my phone and iPad display the reminders for that morning. Which will generally be reminders to print worksheets or copy files to our VLE, the biggest advantage of this is that it doesn't matter what time I arrive at work, I will get the reminders when I need them.</p>

<h5>Notes</h5>

<p>As with Mail and Calendar, notes are a simple but effective feature of iCloud. While I personally don't use them to produce long lengthy documents, they do allow me to quickly jot down important pieces of information and access them quickly. For example I use Notes to quickly access my three photocopy codes.</p>

<h5>Documents and Data</h5>

<p>Documents and Data is one of the most useful features of iCloud. It will keep all apps, which support iCloud, in sync across multiple devices. For example create a Pages document on your Mac and it will immediately sync to your iPad and iWork in the cloud.</p>

<p>The theory is simple turn it on and forget about it, iCloud will deal with the rest.</p>

<h5>Photostream</h5>

<p>Photostream is a feature of iCloud which allows you to instantly share new photos between all of your connected devices which have photo sharing turned on. For example, take a photo on your iPhone and it will appear of your iPad and Mac.</p>

<p>There are a few things regarding photostream which are worthing knowing:</p>

<ul>
<li>It is not a backup of your photos, your photos only stay in the cloud for 30 days. If you don't save them to your camera roll, then they will be disappear from any additional iOS devices. However if you use a mac then you can ask iPhoto or Aperture to automatically import any new photos from your photostream.</li>
<li>Photos in your photostream do not get counted against your iCloud storage.</li>
<li>You can create a shared photostream to be shared with friends and family, this allows new photos to automatically appear on their devices.</li>
</ul>


<p>So while photostream is a useful tool and a great way to share photos, it is not necessarily the best option for keeping your photos safe. Recently I've been playing around with <a href="http://www.flickr.com">Flickr</a>, which can be setup to automatically upload any new photos you take. With a terrabyte of free storage, you aren't likely to run out of space any time soon!</p>

<h5>Keychain</h5>

<p>The final feature of iCloud is the keychain, which allows you to save usernames/passwords and use them on all of your iOS and OSX devices. I have only recently started to use this feature and I am still trying to figure out how it fits into my daily workflow.</p>

<p>The truth is at this point I don't feel qualified enough to write about the keychain feature in any level of detail and many people have done a fantastic job of writing about it. In particular I recommend taking a look at <a href="http://www.imore.com/icloud-keychain-ultimate-guide">'How to use iCloud Keychain: The ultimate guide'</a> over on iMore, if you are interested in making full use of it.</p>

<p>I should also say that I am only using it for non-essential username and passwords, just to make working with a few websites easier and less frustrating. For the rest of my password management I use <a href="https://agilebits.com/onepassword">1Password</a>, an app I throughly recommend.</p>

<hr />

<p>I've begun work on part 2 of this write-up which covers the range of apps I have found particularly useful on a daily basis. It is going to take a little while to complete that post, so bare with me and I'll get it posted as soon as I can.</p>
