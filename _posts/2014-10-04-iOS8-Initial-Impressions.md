So after using iOS 8 for a couple of weeks, I thought I would post some initial thoughts.

* 3rd party keyboards are pretty great! While it certainly isn't the only option, the new TextExpander keyboard is fantastic. Finally being as to use my snippets in any app is absolutely brilliant. Although it should also be said that the new predictive default keyboard is also really good, a huge step up on apples part.
* Extensions are going to open up iOS in a way that we haven't seen before. A perfect example is the 1Password extension, the fact that I no longer need to switch between Safari and 1Password to get a password, has already made my life so much easier. I just bring up the share sheet (*surely we need a new name for it...*), tap the extension and away you go.
* The new hand off features are interesting, although I've yet to figure out how much I'll use it. I will say that I was extremely happy to find out that you could turn off the function that allowed you to answer phone calls on your iPad, which I could see quickly becoming a nightmare when teaching a class (*for future reference it can be found under Settings > FaceTime > iPhone Cellular Calls*)
* The new option to add widgets to Notification Center is cool, but I can see that it will be easy to end up with a lot of clutter. 
* iCloud Drive is nice and I could see it possibly becoming my main cloud storage but I'm going to wait until Yosemite is released before I make any decisions.

Unfortunately there are some interesting bugs still cropping up and truthfully I can't help but wonder if iOS 8 could have done with another couple of months in beta. However for the most part I have been impressed and I'm really looking forward to seeing how developers make use of the new features.
