Hi everyone! 

This is just a very quick update, I'm sorry there hasn't been a lot going on the blog recently. A combination of work and study has meant I haven't really had a chance to sit down and write anything meaningful.

This week in particular I've been focused on finishing my final assignment for my OU degree, the good news the first draft is now complete and I'm hoping by the end of next weekend I'll be finished. It's taken me almost 7 years to complete my degree and I still can't completely believe that within a few short weeks, it will finally be over!

I've got a load of things I want to write about and I promise I'll start updating again as soon as possible.

However I do have one thing which I want to share, I got a chance to see Wreck-it Ralph during the week and the animated short which was shown before it 'Paperman' was amazing. If you haven't seen it yet, do yourself a favour and take 7 minutes to watch it. I promise you won't regret it.
