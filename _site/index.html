    <p class="muted">20 April 2014</p>
    <p><p>So its taken a little while but here is part 2 of my 'Working with iPad' post, the main reason for the delay since the last post is that any awful lot has changed in just the past few months and I needed to spend some time going back over my current workflow. It has also taken me a while to figure out how I wanted to present this information, I've decided to go with what I currently have on my own iPad home screen along with an explanation for why that particular app has found a home on my device. Alongside each explanation, I have included direct links (<em>they are not affiliate links</em>) to the websites, iTunes links and any additional articles which may provide some extra information.</p>

    <h2 class="posttitle">Comic Book Reading Apps</h2>
    <p class="muted">16 March 2014</p>
    <p><p>Alongside my recent move to purchasing digital comics, came the need to select a comic book reading app for my iPad. Ideally I was looking for an app which would allow me to read my comic book files straight from my synology NAS without the need to sync them onto my iPad unless I wanted to. It took a while but I eventually found <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/comicglass-comicreader/id363992049?mt=8">ComicGlass</a> and it does everything I needed it to.</p>

    <h2 class="posttitle">Getting Digital Distribution Right ....</h2>
    <p class="muted">15 March 2014</p>
    <p><p>Over the past couple of weeks, I've been reading a lot more comics both old and new. After listening to <a href="http://www.esn.fm/giant-size/3-jokey-jokey-bang-bang">episode 3</a> of the recently relaunched Giant Size which focused on new and aspiring readers, I was inspired to give a few new titles a try. Up until now I've always brought my graphics novels in paperback, mainly because I always felt they looked good on the shelf. However my flat isn't exactly the largest and I'm running out of storage space pretty fast. After hearing so much about comixology on various podcasts I was more than ready to setup an account and get buying. However after doing some further research, I decided that maybe that wasn't my best option.</p>

    <h2 class="posttitle">Using Flickr</h2>
    <p class="muted">17 February 2014</p>
    <p><p>Flickr is a combination of photo storage and photo sharing, providing you with access to 1TB of free storage. In regard to photo sharing the general idea behind Flickr is that anything you upload is public and therefore anyone can see it. However it is possible to change those default settings so everything you upload remains private. This post will talk you through making use of Flickr to create a private photo storage area, which can be shared with family and friends if you want.</p>

    <h2 class="posttitle">Working with the iPad - Part 1</h2>
    <p class="muted">16 February 2014</p>
    <p><p>One statement I hear on an almost daily basis is that you can't do that on an iPad, 'that' could be creating a document, spreadsheet or presentation, or anything else which would be considered as needing to be done on a 'traditional' computer. I was talking to a colleague at school recently who asked me about buying a laptop in order to allow them to work from home. When I enquired about the iPad they own, they told me it could only be used for surfing and e-mail, not for proper work.</p>
