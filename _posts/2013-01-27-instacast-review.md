For anyone who doesn't know what Instacast is, it allows you to subscribe to podcasts and download them straight to your iDevice without needing to connect to iTunes. In short it makes things a very easy if you subscribe to a lot of podcasts.

I was a big user of Instacast 2 using both the iPad and iPhone versions and while in theory the two versions were meant to sync via iCloud it never exactly worked as it should. So when they announced the release of version 3, along with a brand new syncing system I happily paid the upgrade cost. I would have been happy if all they had upgraded was the syncing but they also added a range of new features which make the upgrade worth it.

The first new feature is that it has now been upgraded to a Universal app, so while this is a paid upgrade at least you only have to purchase it once. Along with this they have gotten rid of the in-app purchases, which used to be necessary if you wanted to create playlists, configure your subscriptions and get push notifications when new episodes were available. All of these features are now available straight out of the box.

I'll come to these features in a bit, but first I want to talk about the syncing. During my walk to and from work I listen to a range of different podcasts (which I'll cover later on), however I also suffer from rarely being able to get more than a few hours sleep each night. As a result I also to tend to continue to listening at night, the advantage of the new sync system is that I can stop playing a podcast on my phone, pick up my iPad which is always next to my bed and continue straight from where I left off. 

Vemedio have ditched iCloud syncing, which was nothing but a complete pain to get working properly and from what I understand is something that causes many developers problems. Instead they have created their own cloud sync option based on WebDav and it works brilliantly. It's quick and other than having to create an account when you first launch the app, you don't know it's there. As well as the playback positions, all of your subscriptions, bookmarks and played episodes are synced as well.

Speaking of subscriptions Instacast contains a constantly updating directory of podcasts (which according to Vemedio's website contains over 30,000). You can browse through different genre listings or charts and perform a search a search if you know what you are looking for. You simply hit the subscribe button and its loaded into you list. It is also worth noting that Instacast supports the ability to enter podcast URL's manually.

You have complete control over each subscription, such as whether new episodes download automatically and get added to a playlist straight away. You can also choose when episodes are deleted from your devices with the options to delete upon playback completion or when you mark them as played. You can also configure the push notifications for each and even park your active subscriptions, a useful feature when you only want to listen to odd episodes.

Instacast now has a similar look on both the iPhone and iPad and while it is clean and easy to use, it does seem a strange choice. An awful lot of the screen real estate on the iPad now seems wasted and if I'm honest I did prefer the old versions interface. It also seems strange to me that even with all of that real estate, they chose to hide the additional playback options until you press a wrench icon. I can understand it on the iPhone, where you simply swipe left to show them but on the iPad it just doesn't seem to make much sense. However it is a minor point and one that I have gotten quickly used to.

Finally Instacast has all of the playback controls which you would expect such as a sleep timer with a range of increments, the ability to change the playback speed and continuous play which can be set to move back or forth through your current playlist.

There are a number of different podcatchers available on the App Store, however the main ones which seem to be continuously compared are Instacast, Downcast and Apple's own podcasts app. I've never used Downcast so I can't really comment on it compared to Instacast, but I did try Podcasts for a while, which isn't a patch on Instacast. Yes, it's free but the truth it's one of the least Apple like apps I've ever used, it feels clunky and painfully slow to use. 

In short I love Instacast, its a great app which fulfils  its intended purpose of allowing me to manage my podcasts with ease and simplicity. Apple should seriously consider taking a page out of Vedemio's book during their next redesign of their Podcasts app.

It is available for the price of Â£2.99 and you can find it on the App Store by clicking here.
