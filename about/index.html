<p>Other than the stuff in the sidebar, what can I say about myself...

<p> I completed my Assessment Only Teacher Training in December 2013 and I am currently half way through my term as an NQT (I still can't believe just how fast this has all gone!). I teach a range of subjects including Media Studies, Music and Citizenship to Year 7 right through to 6th form.</p>

<p>While I've been focusing on my new teaching role, I also still serve as the Digital Media Manager for the school helping to drive the schools ICT policies and use of technology.</p>

<p>In September 2013 I completed my Open University Open Degree achieving a 2.2 with honours.</p>

<p>I started this blog while undergoing CBT therapy in order to have an outlet for views and creative side. Most importantly I wanted to start writing for myself rather than work or study.</p>
