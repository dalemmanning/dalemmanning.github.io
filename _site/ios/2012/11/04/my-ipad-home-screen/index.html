    <h2 class="posttitle">My iPad Home Screen</h2>
    <p class="muted">04 November 2012</p>
    <p>So over the past few months more and more of my friends and colleagues have been purchasing iPads, as a result I'm frequently asked what apps they should consider purchasing. I will usually then respond with a rather detailed e-mail explaining different options which may be beneficial to them.</p>

<p>So I've decided maybe I should actually write down what apps I use, along with an explanation for why they get used on a daily basis.</p>

<p><img src="/img/postimages/MyiPadHomescreen.gif" alt="My iPad Home Screen" /></p>

<p>The wallpaper is created by <a href="http://simoncpage.co.uk/blog/2012/03/ipad-hd-retina-wallpaper/" title="Simon C Page">Simon C Page</a> and I found out about it through a post on the <a href="http://www.macdrifter.com/2012/11/some-retina-quality-ipad-wallpapers-link.html" title="MacDrifter">MacDrifter</a> website.</p>

<p><strong>On The Dock: Safari, Calendar, Mail, Reminders, Camera+ and Settings</strong></p>

<p>Camera+ has completely taken the place of the default camera app on both my iPad and iPhone. It has some really nice features such as timer and burst mode (features that really should be in the default camera surely?).</p>

<p>Safari, Calendar, Mail and Reminders are used daily both at work and at home, the integration between iOS 6 and Mountain Lion has made them even more useful.</p>

<p><strong>Facebook and Twitter:</strong>
If I'm honest while I don't really post anything to Facebook it is a good way to keep in touch with friends and family, so it does get checked a couple of times a day. As for Twitter until a few days ago it was only used to follow people I was interested in, I seem to remember creating the account a couple of years ago just to see what all of the fuss was about!</p>

<p>However since the launch of the blog, I do plan on trying to make better use of it so if you are interested in following me click on the @Twitter link in the site header.</p>

<p><strong>Flipboard:</strong>
Flipboard is my newsreader of choice for keeping up with general news feeds. The biggest advantage to me is that they provide you with a number of news feeds which amalgamate the feeds from a number of different sites. So for example the 'Apple News' section includes the articles from TUAW, MacStories and iMore (three sites I read every single day). Its also available for the iPhone so my feeds are available on the go, which is very handy when you have bit of time to kill!</p>

<p><strong>Pocket:</strong>
Pocket is a great free service which allows me to file articles to be read later, it integrates perfectly with Flipboard and Safari. The Safari bookmarklet is particularly handy when I'm conducting research for work or my OU course, I'll just send it to pocket and read through it later on. Once I've read an article, if I think it will be particularly useful to keep hold of I can archive it straight over to Evernote.</p>

<p><strong>Day One:</strong>
I've been making a real effort to keep a daily journal over the past few months and this provides me with the best chance of making sure I do actually write something everyday. It has a universal iOS app and Mac app which are all linked together through iCloud, which means it doesn't matter what device I write my entry on they all sync together. I particularly love the recent addition of adding photos to your entries, now I'll just fire up the app on my iPad/iPhone and snap a quick picture straight into my diary entry for the day. Its also worth noting that Day One integrates very nicely with Camera+ if you have it installed.</p>

<p><strong>iA Writer:</strong>
Quickly becoming one of my most used apps, all of my blog posts are being composed within iA Writer due to its markdown support and everything is saved as plain text. Its another universal iOS app and Mac app which are also linked together via iCloud. The thing I love the most about it is that its a clean, simple app which allows me to just focus on what I'm writing.</p>

<p><strong>iWork:</strong>
Being a mac user iWork has been my office suite of choice for years and the iOS apps were some of the very first I brought for my iPad. However I always found the method loading files onto the iPad a pain and while I did some work on my iPad I generally found myself firing up my mac to work on a document or presentation. That all changed with the release of Mountain Lion and the full iCloud integration, I will now find myself grabbing my iPad while sitting on the sofa and continuing work on a file.</p>

<p><strong>Evernote:</strong>
As you might of guessed from the amount of iCloud integrated apps I work with, I'm a big fan of cloud based workflows. I'm still fairly new to Evernote but I'm finding myself using it more and more, its quickly becoming my digital filing cabinet for work and home.</p>

<p><strong>Goodreader:</strong>
Again this is one of my very first iPad apps and it is still used daily, Goodreader is great all round document viewer and in particular handles huge PDF files with no problems at all. However its biggest advantage is its integration with Dropbox, Skydrive and Box.net as well as its ability to access network shares. Its one of the best file handling apps I've come across and even when I try a new one out I always end up returning to Goodreader.</p>

<p><strong>Accounts:</strong>
Now I'm sure I'm not using half of the features this app has, but it allows me to easily track all of my bank accounts. I used to use a spreadsheet, but I find this a lot quicker to keep up-to-date.</p>

<p><strong>1Password:</strong>
1Password is a very secure digital filing cabinet for any of your sensitive digital information. Behind one extremely strong master password live all of my usernames and passwords, software serial codes and various other bits of information. In an age when we all have multiple online accounts we need try and keep track of, 1Password definitely makes the job a lot easier.</p>

<p><strong>Rowmote:</strong>
An excellent app which turns my iPad into a remote control and a wireless keyboard and mouse for my mac. At work it allows me to have my laptop plugged into the projector and control it or enter information wherever I am in the room. Another one of my apps which is used multiple times throughout my work day.</p>

<p><strong>IMDB:</strong>
Isn't really a lot I can say about IMDB other than its a great reference tool.</p>

<p><strong>My Movies for iPad Pro:</strong>
All of my DVDs currently live in folders in an effort to save on shelf space. My Movies is what allows me to have still have access to the sleeve information for each DVD, as well as provided full lists of the cast and other technical information. Whenever I get a new DVD, I just scan the barcode using the camera on the iPad and it gets instantly added to my database.</p>

<p><strong>Kindle and iBooks:</strong>
While iBooks is still my e-reader of choice for large number of ebooks I've accumulated over the years, I now buy all of my new eBooks in the Kindle format. The reason of this is fairly simple, the Kindle app is available on just about every platform and iBooks is not. Should the day come when I don't have an iPad (even the thought of that happening causes me to break out in a cold sweat!!), I can just pickup a Kindle and still have access to my library.</p>
