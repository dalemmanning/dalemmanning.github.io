    <h2 class="posttitle">Skyfall</h2>
    <p class="muted">29 October 2012</p>
    <p>After the success of Casino Royale, everyone had thought we were entering a new era of the Bond film. Then came along Quantum Of Solace, which its fair to say wasn't exactly  the film everyone was hoping for. So the question we now need to ask is … after a four year hiatus does Skyfall deliver?</p>

<p>Well according to a few people I know, the answer is no. In fact one of my closest friends wrote a review over on his blog 'The Random Viewer', you can read it by <a href="http://therandomviewer.wordpress.com/2012/10/26/skyfall-how-the-mighty-have-fallen/" title="clicking here">clicking here</a>, explaining his frustrations. Now most of the time I completely side with his views on Film and TV, however in this case I'm afraid I'm going to have to completely disagree.</p>

<p>The latest Bond film to me is a fitting tribute to the 50th anniversary of the franchise and while in some respects it may be seen as a slightly trimmed down offering in terms of the exotic locations and the gadgets being used. I don't think this is a bad thing, don't get me wrong I love the early bond films however it was starting to getting a little ridiculous by the time we got to Die Another Day in terms of the gadgets 007 was being deployed with. I am still curious to know who genuinely thought that giving Bond an invisible car was a good idea.</p>

<p>Casino Royale made efforts to change that and while Skyfall does re-introduce some fan favourites such as Q, it isn't done in way that is unbelievable, a fact that even Q makes reference in the film. I thought Ben Whishaw as the young Q played off excellently against Craig's older, damaged and worn Bond. After all anybody who can announce "I can do more damaged sitting in my pyjamas on my laptop before my first cup of earl grey then you can do in a year in the field" has got to be alright in my book (but that could just be the geek in me talking!).</p>

<p>While I will agree that the Bond girls (or is it meant to be Bond women now?) aren't necessarily utilised as much as in previous incarnations. I do think that the balance was appropriate for a film, which seems to focus primarily on whether Bond is a relic of the cold war era and whether the world really needs people like him anymore.</p>

<p>Finally ,what about the product placement people keep going on about? Well truth be told it really didn't bother me and I didn't really feel it was over the top. After all product placement is a reality of the film and television industry these days, although I will agree with my friend that some of the placement was pretty hilarious!</p>

<p>So would I recommend it - absolutely! While it may not be the very best Bond film we've seen, it does take some bold risks which in my opinion work well. The nod back to some of Bond's previous exploits was a nice touch that any fan of the franchise should greatly enjoy and appreciate. With the recent news that we can expect the next Bond to be released in 2014, I personally can't wait to see what they will do next.</p>

<p>James Bond Will Return …</p>
