Hopefully you have noticed that the blog has received a new look and indeed a new home! I am now the proud owner of dalemmanning.me.uk and this redesign represents something I've been thinking about ever since I actually started blogging. I've always believed that if you want to write something public you need to be brave enough to put your own name on it and so this is my final step to doing that (_although I also fully acknowledge that there are times when remaining anonymous is important as well_). 

Wordpress is gone and this site is now fully Jekyll based. I haven't got a problem with Wordpress and I can see why so may people use it, but it just didn't give me the flexibility I wanted. The site is still very much work in progress and part of me was tempted to wait before I pushed it out the world, but I really wanted to start posting again and as it stands the site is ready for use. So from time to time you may well see new features being pushed out.

I've also removed a couple of the posts I wasn't happy with, in particular the Trailer Watch posts have gone. This maybe something I revisit in the future, but for now they are no more. Just about everything else is here and I plan on writing the next instalment of the Batman reread, along with my review of Pacific Rim and The Wolverine very soon.

In the meantime, thanks for checking out the new site. If you have any comments or come across something which isn't working; you can contact me on [Twitter][dmtwitter] and [App.net][dmappnet], alternatively you can e-mail me at desk@dalemmanning.me.uk.
