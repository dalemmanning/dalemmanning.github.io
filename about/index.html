  <H5 class="sidebar">About Me</h5>

<p>Other than the stuff in the sidebar, what can I say about myself...

<p>I am Curriculum Leader Media Studies at a secondary school on the south coast of England. As well as Media Studies, I also teach Citizenship and Music to year 8, 10 and 11.</p>

<p>While my main focus is now learning the role of curriculum leader, I also still occasionally serve as the Digital Media Manager for the school helping to drive the schools ICT policies and use of technology.</p>

<p>In September 2013 I completed my Open University Open Degree achieving a 2.2 with honours.</p>

<p>I started this blog while undergoing CBT therapy in order to have an outlet for views and creative side. Most importantly I wanted to start writing for myself rather than work or study.</p>
