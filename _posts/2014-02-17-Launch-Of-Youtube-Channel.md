Over the past week I've been working on some new teaching materials for use with my 6th Form classes. In particular I've been creating screencasts for them to use as reference materials even if I'm not teaching them during a particular lesson.

They have had a positive response from the students and other members of staff, so I have decided to share them via my own [YouTube][youtubechannel] channel. If you find them useful please feel free to make use of them, I only ask that you credit me and the site appropriately.

I'll be adding videos which cover a range of subjects over the next few weeks/months, but at the moment I'm focusing on Photoshop CS3 as my students are currently completing the print/e-media component of their practical projects.
