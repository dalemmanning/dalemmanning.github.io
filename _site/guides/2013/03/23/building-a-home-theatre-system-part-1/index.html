    <h2 class="posttitle">Building a home theatre system - Part 1</h2>
    <p class="muted">23 March 2013</p>
    <p>I've had a few people ask me over the past few months about my home theatre setup, so I decided to spend some time detailing how I go about it all and exactly why I began this project.</p>

<p>Please be aware this isn't going to be a quick and easy guide to converting all of your media. I plan to write a pretty in depth piece here, so that I can make sure I explain everything properly. As a result I will probably split this up into two or three posts.</p>

<h5>The Background</h5>

<p>Generally one of the questions I get asked is why bother? The first answer is because it just makes everything so much easier, if I want to watch an episode of a particular TV show I can just load it up, navigate to the show I want and hit play. I don't have to turn on the blu-ray player, put in the DVD with the correct episode on and then wait for the inevitable trailers, studio information and menus to all load up.</p>

<p>The other answer is to save space. To give you a clue here how much space I'm talking about I own just over 50 different TV series (and each of those is generally the full run of currently available episodes) and just over 600 movies. They used to live on four bookcases filled top to bottom before I moved last year, now I just don't have the space for that.</p>

<p>I've been converting all of my media for around the past year, I've almost finished converting my TV boxsets (it would be fair to say that this has been a rather large project!). Most of my TV boxsets are now in my parents attic in plastic containers, that have plenty of packets of silicon to keep any potential moisture away from them. The movies have been moved to three 240 disk folders and I plan to eventually convert all of those as well.</p>

<h5>The Hardware</h5>

<p>My media system is based around the following hardware:</p>

<ul>
<li>Storage :: 2 x 3TB Western Digital My Book Live Drives</li>
<li>Playback device :: Apple TV 2 (Jailbroken)</li>
<li>The Computer :: 2.5GHz i5 21.5" iMac with 12GB RAM</li>
<li>Networking :: Wired networking plus a set of powerline ethernet adapters.</li>
</ul>


<p>You can find a full explanation for everything below:</p>

<h5>Storage</h5>

<p>The biggest factor you have when faced with a project like this is the amount of storage you are going to require. The average size of a TV episode is around 600MB, yes I could compress this even further but I've found this is the size which gives me the picture quality I'm happiest with. The average size of a film is between 1.5GB to 2GB based on its length.</p>

<p>In other words I was going to need large amount of hard drive space in order to do things properly and it was this factor which slowed down the whole project for around 6 months. Around 6 months ago I purchased two 3TB Western Digital My Book Live drives (which I was able to get when they were seriously reduced during a sale). The drives are great and almost ideal for what I wanted to use them for. I say almost because they don't have any real redundancy built into them. As I don't really fancy having to convert everything all over again, I do plan to invest in a drive which can be RAIDED at some point in the near future. They do however have networking built into them, which was essential for what I had planned.</p>

<h5>Playback device</h5>

<p>The ideal playback device changes depending on who you speak to, some will recommend a dedicated PC/Mac or just using your games console (The xbox 360 and PS3 have some pretty decent media software built straight into them).</p>

<p>I went with an ATV2 and for a while I did try using it as Apple intended, with everything running through iTunes. However as my library started to grow, iTunes slowly became more unusable taking greater lengths of time to load. So I decided to try jailbreaking the ATV, it was something I was resistant to a first but the truth is that is has dramatically increased the usability of the little black box. I can now run XBMC, which has the ability to connect straight to the network shares on my hard drives and removes the need to use iTunes completely.</p>

<p>Another huge advantage of the ATV2 is that its instantly on whenever I need it and uses very little in the way of power consumption.</p>

<p>OK so this is where I take a slight sidestep, last year Apple released a new version of the ATV with improved specs. Great you may think, sounds perfect! Well not exactly ... at the time of writing this post there is no working jailbreak for it. While you can still get the ATV2 be warned it isn't going to come cheap, the price has increased dramatically over the past 6-8 months.</p>

<h5>The Computer</h5>

<p>The only thing I use my computer for in regards to my home theatre setup is the actual conversion of my media, otherwise everything else is handled by the ATV and the hard drives. The software I use for converting my media will be covered in part 2.</p>

<p>You can obviously use just about any machine for converting your media, I use an iMac because well … I'm a mac guy. The only thing I would say is that regardless of what type of machine you plan to use, chuck as much RAM into it as you possibly can. Trust me when I say it makes a huge difference and in my case I found the conversion time for an entire 24 episode series almost halved.</p>

<h5>Networking</h5>

<p>If you are going to go with a similar setup to what I'm describing here, then at some point your media is going to be transmitted via a network. If you can get away with running physical cables between your devices, I highly recommend that you do so. I tried running via wifi for a while and while my TV episodes were ok, I found once I started streaming my movies I suffered from having to regularly buffer the stream. Switching back to cables made a huge difference in performance, I can stream full HD files without any problems.</p>

<p>I realise this is not always practical for everyone, I live in a single floor flat where just about every major piece of kit is located in one room so its relatively straightforward for me. The only exception to this is my router which needs to be located elsewhere, so I've also thrown some powerline ethernet adapters into the equation in order to provide internet access to my ATV.</p>

<hr />

<p>That's it for now, thanks for sticking with me so far. Hopefully you've found it useful. Next time I'll go through the software I use for both the conversion process and playback. Check back next week for part 2 and if you like what I've written, please let me know via twitter or the comments below.</p>
