A new feature for the site, in which i'll share some of the articles I've found interesting over the past week.

- _[The potential downside to Veronica Mars' Kickstarter success](http://www.denofgeek.com/movies/24822/the-potential-downside-to-veronica-mars-kickstarter-success) :: Den Of Geek_ - An interesting point of view which looks at why the overwhelming success of the Veronica Mars' kickstarter could actually be bad news when you consider the original purpose of kickstarter.

- _[Google Reader is useful, reliable service that suffered from shameful neglect](http://www.suntimes.com/technology/ihnatko/18854273-452/google-reader-is-useful-reliable-service-that-suffered-from-shameful-neglect.html) :: Chicago Sun-Times_ - As always Andy Ihnatko presents a balanced view on the shutdown of Google Reader.

- _[Alfred 2: Rewritten From The Ground Up, Workflows, Themes, and More](http://www.macstories.net/reviews/alfred-2-rewritten-from-the-ground-up-workflows-themes-and-more/) :: Macstories_ - An excellent review of the latest review of Alfred, after reading this I decided it was time to give it another go.

- _[TV Tuesday: Battlestar Galactica (1978) E01 â€“ E03: Saga of a Star World](http://therandomviewer.wordpress.com/2013/03/12/tv-tuesday-battlestar-galactica-1978-e01-e03-saga-of-a-star-world/) :: The Random Viewer_ - my good friend the random viewer has started TV Tuesdays and what better way to start it off other than the original Battlestar Galactica! Seriously you are going to want to check this out each week, he is approaching it from the point of view of never having watched it before. The fact that he has and knows what he is in for, makes it essential reading.

This it for this week there will be more next Sunday.
